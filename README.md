### Hi there, I'm Karl 👋

## I am a student, developer, and lifelong learner 
- 🎓 I have a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from [Colorado State University Global][csug-degree]
- 🛡️ I am pursuing a second M.Sc. in Cybersecurity Studies from [American Public University][apu-degree]
- 🧠 I have a B.Sc. in Neuroscience from [Washington State University][wsu-neuro]
- 📚 I'm dedicated to finding a way to bridge my passions of neuroscience and technology
- 🧬 I have started a personal research project into biologically inspired artificial evolutionary neural networks
- 🥅 Goal for 2023: To find a challenging and rewarding position where I can apply my skills to create innocative technology solutions (Check out [my LinkedIn profile][linkedin] if your hiring!)
- ⚡️ Fun fact about me: I love to play the drums! 🥁

### Projects and Coursework
Since the majority of my programming experience has come from school, I wanted to make sure the projects and prgrams I created at University were easily accessible. I've created repositories for all classes which had some aspect of programming involved. 

#### AI/ML Capstone Project
- In depth analysis of generative adversarial neworks and four industry use cases: [Link to paper](https://github.com/karlestes1/CSC-580---Applying-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Portfolio%20Project/Final/GAN_Paper.pdf)
- Implementing a generative adversarial network to learn to generate a random class from the CIFAR10 dataset: [Link to code](https://github.com/karlestes1/CSC-580---Applying-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Portfolio%20Project/Final/main.py)

#### Favorite Projects
- A [cognitive decline predictor](https://github.com/karlestes1/CSC-510---Foundations-of-Artificial-Intelligence#portfolio-project-cognitive-decline-predictor) for detecting and classifying cognitive decline in individuals based on survey responses and MRI data
- A basic [autonomous vehicle simulation](https://github.com/karlestes1/CSC-525---Principles-of-Machine-Learning#portfolio-project-ml-agents---autonomous-vehicle) implemented Unity with the ML-Agents Toolkitand trained via reinforcement learning.
- Implementing [hyperparameter tuning with a multithreaded approach](https://github.com/karlestes1/CSC-580---Applying-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks#critical-thinking-5-improving-the-accuracy-of-a-neural-network) to improve the accuracy of an artificial neural netowrk
